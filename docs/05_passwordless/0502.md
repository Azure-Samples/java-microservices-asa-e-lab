# Create an admin account for the MySQL Flexible Server

Now that these secrets are deleted from the Key Vault, you will need to create a managed identity to link to the admin account of your MySQL Flexible server. This managed identity will be associated with your own user account in one of the next steps where you create the service connections. You can use the following guidance to perform this task:

   ```bash
   DB_ADMIN_USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME=uid-dbadmin-$APPNAME-$UNIQUEID
   
   ADMIN_IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID=$(az identity create \
    --name $DB_ADMIN_USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --query id \
    --output tsv)
   ```
