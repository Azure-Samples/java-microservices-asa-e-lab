# Test the application through the publicly available endpoint

If any of the deployments failed, you can check the logs of a specific app using the following CLI statement (using `customers-service` as an example):

```bash
az spring app logs --name ${CUSTOMERS_SERVICE} --follow
```

Now that you have deployed all of your microservices, verify that the application is accessible via a web browser.

## Step by step guidance

1. To list all deployed apps, from the Git Bash shell, run the following CLI statement, which will also list all publicly accessible endpoints:

   ```bash
   az spring app list --service $SPRING_APPS_SERVICE \
                      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
                      --output table
   ```

1. You can also `grep` the URL that got assigned to the `api-gateway` service. 

   ```bash
   az spring app show --name ${API_GATEWAY} | grep url
   ```

1. Alternatively, you can switch to the web browser window displaying the Azure portal interface, navigate to your Azure Spring Apps instance and select **Apps** from the vertical navigation menu. In the list of apps, select **api-gateway**, on the **api-gateway - Overview** page, note the value of the **URL** property.

1. Open another web browser tab and navigate to the URL of the api-gateway endpoint to display the application web interface.

1. You can also navigate to the URL of the admin-server to see insight information of your microservices.
